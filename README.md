I'm  working on the BrandExpress projectã€‚
BrandExpress is a Virtual Teller Machine that looks like an ATM, but it is so much more. With BrandExpress, you can have a real time, face-to-face conversation with a BrandBank Sales & Service Specialist. Video technology at BrandExpress and in our Sales & Service Center allows you to have a "face-to-face" interaction. You choose the level of privacy you are comfortable with by either speaking normally using the built-in sound system, using the handset, your own earbuds or headset, the chat feature on the screen, or the built-in scanner. You don't even need your ATM or debit card to use BrandExpress; just tap the screen to begin a conversation. The Specialist will do all the work.
